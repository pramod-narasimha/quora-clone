I passed out in 2011 in Computer Science. \n\nRecently, I got admission in Master in Applied Computer Science (MACS) in Canada.  Is it worth going after all these years gap ?\n\nIf you ask me what you did in all these years, I tried multiple things but failed at everything I tried. \n\nI wrote GATE exam in 2014 and got 2k AIR. Didn't do Mtech because I was looking for IITs only. I thought of becoming GATE tutor then. But that didn't work out. I tried for Onsite in previous company and here. But nobody gave me shit about it. I learned Python, Machine Learning, Data Science blah blah blah. But nobody gave me a chance without prior experience. \n\nBecoming a Team lead and then a Manager is the only option for me. But that all looks like a bullshit for me. I never wanted to go at managerial side. \n\nUpon hearing that I'm planning for Masters at this age (29 years old), people are making fun of me. But for me this is very valuable. Please note that I'm not taking any risk here. I'm planning to go on Sabbatical and then study. If something goes wrong, I hope TCS will be there for me.\n\nAll I want is to here your valuable opinions and comments and what would you suggest for a guy like me. I'm going through a tough time in convincing my family and few of our colleagues.",
